# NS-Website
Template website for a National School.

## Requirements
1. ANT (to generate the HTML from XSL transformation).

## HTML generation
1. Run the `build.sh` file. This will call the build script that generates the HTML artefacts within the `../web` folder.

## File Structure
* `../bin` contains binaries and build files.
* `../data` contains data files used during transformation.
* `../web` contains web artefacts (e.g. HTML, CSS, JS, media, etc.).
* `../styles` contains the XSL transformation stylesheets.
