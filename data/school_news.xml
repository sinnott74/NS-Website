<title>Parking outside the school (#3)</title>
<content>Please do not use the staff car park in the mornings or evenings. 
Staff need to be able to access their spaces so they can come into work and take charge of your children.
They should not be obstructed from leaving in the evening either. 
The car park is also our assembly area, in case of a fire, so it needs to be kept free. 
The set down area is for parents to drop their children and leave. 
If you wish to bring your child into the school you can park a little further up the road. 
Please don’t park on the double yellow lines or in front of our neighbours’ houses/entrances.</content>
