<div class="news-item-title">Parking outside the school (#3)</div>
<div class="news-item-text-content">Please do not use the staff car park in the mornings or evenings. <br/>Staff need to be able to access their spaces so they can come into work and take charge of your children.<br/>They should not be obstructed from leaving in the evening either. <br/>The car park is also our assembly area, in case of a fire, so it needs to be kept free. <br/>The set down area is for parents to drop their children and leave. <br/>If you wish to bring your child into the school you can park a little further up the road. <br/>Please don’t park on the double yellow lines or in front of our neighbours’ houses/entrances.</div>
